# Multi-objective-Harris-hawks-optimization-MOHHO-
Welcome. This repository contains the matlab based implementation of the 'Multi-objective Harris hawks optimization'. In this repository, multi objective version of Harris hawks optimization which is proposed by Ali Asghar Heidari et al. at 2019 (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167739X18313530) and its implementation has been published in: https://github.com/aliasghar68/Harris-hawks-optimization-Algorithm-and-applications-/wiki/Harris-Hawks-Optimization-(HHO). To implement MOHHO, i am inspired from MOPSO implementation which is presented by S. Mostapha Kalami Heris and is presented in: https://yarpiz.com/59/ypea121-mopso. 

# Usage
To use from MOHHO, update CostFunction.m with regard to your problem. Also, Parameters such as Nvar, VarMin and VarMax must be customized.
